## GCTrack

The GCTrack extension lets you monitor incremental Garbage Collector (GC) information, the GC introduced in Ruby v2.2.

### Getting started

#### #1 Add the dependency

GCTrack is published to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/gctrack). 
Simply add it as a dependency to your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'gctrack', '~> 0.1.1'
```

#### #2 Enable the extension

```ruby
require 'gctrack'

GC::Tracker.enable # returns true, if the Tracker is now enabled
```

#### #3 Record data

```ruby
GC::Tracker.start_record # returns true, if a new record was started
# DO ACTUAL WORK
gc_cycles, gc_duration_ns, rb_allocations, rb_thread_ctx_switches = GC::Tracker.end_record
```

`#end_record` will return the `gc_cycles` (the amount of gc cycles observed) and
`gc_duration_ns` (their cumulative duration in nanoseconds), since the last
invocation of `#start_record`. It will also return `rb_allocation`, the number
of objects allocated and `rb_thread_ctx_switches` the number of times Ruby
switched between threads during the recording. You can also invoke
`#start_record` recursively as so:

```ruby
GC::Tracker.start_record # Start a first record 
do_work_on(one)
GC::Tracker.start_record # Start a second record 
do_work_on(two)
inner_data = GC::Tracker.end_record # Collect results from second record
do_work_on(three)
outter_data = GC::Tracker.end_record # Collect results from first record
```

In this example, the Array `inner_data` will only contain the GC information resulted of executing `do_work_on(two)`, while 
`outter_data` will contain the GC information resulted from the three exectutions: `do_work_on` `one`, `two` and `three`. 

Effectively, records are stacked and data from a GC cycle will be added to all "currently" records.
